        <h2>Business Cases and Relevant SDG Indicators</h2>
        <p>My business cases focus on energy and education. Below are the SDG indicators and targets relevant to each case:</p>

        <h3>Energy Business Case</h3>
        <p><strong>Relevant SDG Indicators and Targets:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>7.1.1</strong> - Proportion of population with access to electricity</li>
            <li><strong>7.2.1</strong> - Renewable energy share in the total energy mix</li>
            <li><strong>7.3.1</strong> - Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP</li>
            <li><strong>7.A.1</strong> - International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Education Business Case</h3>
        <p><strong>Relevant SDG Indicators and Targets:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>4.1.1</strong> - Proportion of children and young people achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading and mathematics</li>
            <li><strong>4.2.1</strong> - Proportion of children under 5 years of age who are developmentally on track in health, learning, and psychosocial well-being</li>
            <li><strong>4.3.1</strong> - Participation rate of youth and adults in formal and non-formal education and training</li>
            <li><strong>4.4.1</strong> - Proportion of youth and adults with information and communications technology (ICT) skills</li>
            <li><strong>4.A.1</strong> - Proportion of schools with access to basic services (electricity, internet, computers, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Energy Business Case:</strong> Investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency can not only create profitable business opportunities but also contribute significantly to combating climate change and providing access to clean energy worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Education Business Case:</strong> The rise of digital learning and upskilling programs presents an opportunity to bridge the education gap and empower individuals with the skills needed to thrive in the modern workforce, ultimately fostering social and economic equality.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Relevant Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Several algorithms can be applied to the business case problems in both energy and education sectors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kruskal's Algorithm</strong> - Used for *minimum spanning tree* problems, such as optimizing energy distribution networks or connecting educational facilities in a cost-effective manner. It helps to determine the least costly connections between various network nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong> - Useful for finding the *shortest paths* in a network. For example, it could be applied to find the most efficient routes for distributing energy or educational resources across multiple locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> - Algorithms like *Quick Sort* or *Merge Sort* can be used to efficiently organize data, such as ranking schools by available resources, or sorting energy usage patterns to prioritize areas of high demand.</li>
        </ul>
